I am looking to scrape the entire games catalog of the Xbox online store.

Relevant URLs:
Xbox 360 games: http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Games/All
Xbox One games: https://store.xbox.com/en-US/Xbox-One/Games/

Example 360 game URL:
http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/FIFA-Soccer-13/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d80245410998

Example One game URL:
https://store.xbox.com/en-US/Xbox-One/Games/Far-Cry-4/7f06438e-eefb-4375-96d6-a981e6750c5d

The task is to scrape all data fields such as game 

title, 
developer, 
publisher, 
genre list, 
release date, 
description, 
size, 
price, 
price of various editions/DLCs/season pass, 
# of DLCs/editions, 
# of ratings of DLCs/average rating score, 
? - number of ratings for the game, 
? - average rating score for the game
For 360:
	-features and 
	-online features, 
	-facebook likes

Task is to fetch crawl the individual game URLs for 360 and One, and then scrape all data fields and write to a CSV file. One file for 360 and another for One. One row per game.

Successful completion of project may lead to additional similar projects.

===========================================================================================================



For Xbox 360 games:

E.g. http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/GTA-V/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802545408a7?SortBy=TopRated

Has 45 DLCs (downloadable content), 1 game, 5 videos, etc.

 

So data fields of interest would be such as:

Cell A: (DLC categorized): games (1), game videos (5), game add-ons (10),�.
Cell B: (DLCs #): 45
Cell C: (DCLs): Grand Theft Auto V (249,252 - $59.99), Grand Theft Auto V - Trailer #2 (4,405 - FREE),�
Cell D: (Season pass available): no
Cell E: (Season pass price): -- (e.g. for http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Game-of-Thrones/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d80258411488 this would be $19.99)


For Xbox One games:

E.g. https://store.xbox.com/en-US/Xbox-One/Games/Lara-Croft-and-the-Temple-of-Osiris/18904bca-957f-445f-9f30-1d4ac945bbc9 there are 3 DLCs. One of them is a season pass sold for $9.99 https://store.xbox.com/en-US/Xbox-One/Dlc/Lara-Croft-and-the-Temple-of-Osiris-Season-Pass/85ca11db-ed0e-4af3-91e5-772d3f89d49b

The game also includes bundles. So for this we would like to know

Cell A: (DLCs #): 3
Cell B: (DLCs): Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris: Hitman (65 � unavailable), Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris Season (56 � $9.99),�
Cell C: (bundles): 1
Cell D: (bundle price): $28.99
Cell E (season pass): yes
Cell F: (season pass price): $9.99

Some games come in e.g. standard and �Silver�, and �Gold Editions� and would be listed as options in bundles/DLC. So it would be of interest to have a new data column for D LCs/bundles whose title match the word �edition�.
